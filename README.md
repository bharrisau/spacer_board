=======

Double sided PCB shim to enable stencil8 style assembly without panelising or modifying target board. Combined effort with [nice technology](https://nicegear.co.nz/).

##Update
There are two hole layouts - the 0.1 version has the far right hand column as 5,9,4,0. The newer layout is 8,4,6,2. The newer layout optimises the locations of the pins when in use, and also adds a diagonal slot in the corner.
